To install this patched version of distutils, simply move/copy it to your site-packages folder.

If you're on a version of Pythonista older than 1.6, you also need to modify sys.path on every run of Pythonista to make site-packages take priority over the stdlib. As of 1.6 this is the default and you do not need to do this manually.

It is also recommended to install the pydistutils.cfg file - see the instructions in that file for details.
